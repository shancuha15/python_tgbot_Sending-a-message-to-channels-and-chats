# _Sending a message to channels and chats_ <hr>

## Why was this bot created?

   - _In the previous “Personal tgbot “Artspase shop””, the implementation 
of a simple store was shown, in which we implemented the ability to 
notify the user about new events, product updates, and so on directly 
through the chat with the bot._
   - _Owners of many telegram channels and chats sometimes need to send the 
   same message to all chats and channels at the same time. This telegram 
   bot shows how you can send notifications in one click to many chats and personal channels_.
   - _Editing text for mailing does not involve stopping the bot, which is very convenient. 
   In this example, I considered mailing in 3 chats and 3 channels (works on more)_.
   Note:
   - _There are mandatory conditions for mailing, without which the bot will not work. 
   Firstly, in order to send messages to telegram channels, you MUST make the bot an 
   administrator of this channel. The second - to send messages to telegram chats - you MUST add a bot to the chat_. <hr>

## How does this bot work?
    This telegram bot is designed to be used by an administrator.
    You can also add multiple administrators. 
    Regular users do not have the ability to send notifications. 

    When launched, the bot welcomes the administrator and the "Admin Menu" button appears.
